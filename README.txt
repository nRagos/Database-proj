Hi. Put your stuff here and commit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What has been implemented:
- Login page and user authentication (although very much prone to SQL injections lol)
- Database (needs tweaking)
- Basic Dashboard design
- Navbar clicking mechanics
- Adding, deleting, updating and searching client info
- Cute cats

What still needs to be implemented(based on project guidelines):
- Creating and updating bookings/reservations and hotel occupancy.
- Cancelling a booking and adjusting hotel occupancy.
- Enquiring information regarding, Reservations and Rooms (e.g. check which rooms are occupied, check all reservations etc.)
- Deposits/Payments (not implemented at all)
- Report showing occupancy levels.
Receptionist must be able pick dates and a report on occupancy level must be generated.
- Another report that we need to decide on (We require 2 reports).
